    <span>Hello there.</span>
    <br>
    <span>My name is Aaron Green, and this is my website.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Since we may not know each other, here are a couple of <a href="icebreakers.jpg">icebreakers.</a></span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Now that you've seen the icebreakers, here is more about me.</span>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <span>I'm a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics in May 2019 from UIUC and plan to complete my M.S. in Computer Science in May 2020.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>I am primarily interested in backend development and system programming. For my masters research, I am developing an auto-scaling distributed platform for data science education, research, and applications. You can read more <a href="http://livedatalab.org">here</a>. Although, that website is almost certainly severely out-of-date.</span>

    <br>
    <span>Currently, I'm a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.stripe.com">Stripe</a> working in Go and Ruby on the Developer Experience Products team, where we focus on building tools to ensure Stripe continues to deliver a world-class experience for our users. In the spring of 2019, I was at <a href="https://www.jumptrading.com">Jump Trading</a> working on the risk platform in C++. In the summer of 2018, I was working at <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a> on the Treasury team, making sure all the money added up properly.</span>
