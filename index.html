    <span>Hello there.</span>
    <br>
    <span>My name is Aaron Green, and this is my website.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Since we may not know each other, here are a couple of <a href="icebreakers.jpg">icebreakers.</a></span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span>Now that you've seen the icebreakers, here is more about me.</span>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <span>I'm a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science. I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics in May 2019 from UIUC and plan to complete my M.S. in Computer Science in May 2020.</span>
    <br>
    <span>I am primarily interested in backend development and system programming. For my masters research, I am developing an auto-scaling distributed platform for data science education, research, and applications. You can read more <a href="http://livedatalab.org">here</a>. Although, that website is most likely not up-to-date.</span>
    <br>
    <span>I have recently worked as a software engineering intern at Jump Trading working on the risk platform in high performance C++.</span>
